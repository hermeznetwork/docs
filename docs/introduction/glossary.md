#### BabyJubJub

BabyJubJub is an elliptic curve defined over a large prime field. It's useful in zk-SNARKs proofs.

####  Batch

A batch is a rollup block.

####  Coordinator

An coordinator is a rollup block producer.

####  Forging

Forging refers to the creation of a batch of layer 2 transactions (off-chain), creation of the proof and the subsequent (on-chain) verification of the attached zk-SNARK.
