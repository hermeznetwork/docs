# Scalable token transfers

Why are we focusing on transfers? It turns out that [more than 50% of transactions on the Ethereum network are transfers](https://twitter.com/aliatiia_/status/1277979904324194313), and a significant part of these take place on exchanges. Demand could be reduced by a significant amount if rollups started being used, or (in the optimistic case) even agreed to meet on the same rollup. In addition to significantly reducing transaction costs for users, this would have the added benefit of [greatly reducing gas prices, and freeing up the base chain for more complex contracts](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1277967505932161027).
