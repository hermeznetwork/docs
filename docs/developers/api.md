# REST API


The API is the layer that allows 3rd party apps and services to interface with the coordinator to explore, monitor and use the Hermez rollup.
Example of these apps include:
* Wallet: send L2 transactions, check balance, ...
* Explorer: List transactions, slots, batches, ...
* Exchange integrations


The documentation of the API can be found [here](https://apidoc.hermez.network/)
